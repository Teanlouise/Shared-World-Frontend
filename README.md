SHARED-WORLD FRONTEND

This is the frontend implementation of the shared-world application. Connection with the Django backend is through axios to access rest API functionality. This application is deployed on Firebase with access to App Engine, Cloud Storage and GoogleMapsAPI.

This is the first project I have built using React. Followed a JustDjango Youtube tutorial to assist with the process.

Used 'antd' templates for quicker development and clear layout and VisualStudio for coding.

    Home
        - Main page for the application
        - Dropdown menu of all pre-defined countries
        - Google GeoChart map with countries coloured according to their tourist-to-local ratio (data from queries on the WorldBank public dataset in BigQuery, find at 2017_ratio in shared-world-data repo) 
            - https://react-google-charts.com/data-sources/from-api
            - https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart

        - When users select submit they are redirected to a PostList page 

    About
        - static page explaining how the app works
        - initial first step of selecting continent not implemented

    Profile
        - List of all profiles of users in database
        - Todo: Show the ProfileDetail view of the current user (not implemented due to complexity of authentication)

    PostList
        - Posts are ordered according to the users interests, with the most matches first (generated by Spark program, find at post_match in shared-world-data repo)
        - The data is retrieved from JSON files stored for each user according to country on GCS
        - When the title of the post is selected, redirected to PostDetail View

    PostDetail
        - Shows the details of the seleced post on the left and a card of the author's details on the left
        - Selecting the username of the author will take to ProfileDetail

    ProfileDetail
        - Shows the details of the selected profile in a card on the left and all the posts written by them on the right

DEPLOY
    - Originally to be deployed on app engine, however this was not the best option
    - Deployed on Google Firebase which is designed for frontend apps
    - Due to the api nature of this program and Django they could be deployed seperately
    - This structure provided greater effeciency and results then when running together locally


<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
